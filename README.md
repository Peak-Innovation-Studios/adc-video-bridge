# adc-video-bridge

Bridges Alarm.com security camera streams to local RTSP for HomeKit Secure Video (HKSV) via Homebridge.

This repository is the Peak Innovation Studios maintained fork of
[`Omar-L/adc-video-bridge`](https://github.com/Omar-L/adc-video-bridge). It
preserves the upstream history while carrying tested container hardening,
Synology deployment guidance, and stream-lifecycle fixes. Portable fixes can
still be proposed upstream without mixing this project with the separate
Alarm.com Homebridge plugin.

## Problem

Alarm.com cameras cannot be accessed directly via RTSP **through the web API** — ADC re-provisions camera credentials via OpenVPN and randomly generates root passwords.

> 🔴 **Corrected 2026-08-07.** This premise, which the whole architecture rests on, is true only of the *web* API this project was ported from. Alarm.com's **mobile** API returns per-camera `LocalRtspEndpoint` / `PublicRtspEndpoint` values with working credentials and `SupportsRtspStreaming: true`, and their iOS app streams `connectionType: DIRECT`, `protocolType: RTSP`. The local port is not plain RTSP — it is **RTSP tunnelled over HTTPS**, and as of 2026-08-07 all three cameras have been pulled at live 1080p H.264 with stock ffmpeg (`ffprobe -rtsp_transport https -i "rtsp://<user>:<pass>@<lan-ip>:<port>/s1"`), no cloud and no video token involved. "Cannot be accessed" is simply wrong. ⚠️ That is a *spike*, not an integration — the endpoints still come from an API this codebase cannot yet call; see `docs/INVARIANTS.md` → "What the local-RTSP spike did NOT prove". ⚠️ Note also that **ADC-V515 cameras report `SupportsWebRTC: false`**, so the WebRTC design below cannot serve them at all. See `docs/INVARIANTS.md` and `Journal.md` 2026-08-07. The existing [homebridge-node-alarm-dot-com](https://github.com/node-alarm-dot-com/homebridge-node-alarm-dot-com) plugin handles alarm panel/sensors/locks but has no video support.

## Solution

This bridge authenticates with Alarm.com's web API, negotiates a WebRTC connection to the camera via ADC's end-to-end signaling protocol, receives the H.264 video stream server-side using [werift](https://github.com/nicknisi/werift-webrtc), and republishes it as a local RTSP stream via ffmpeg → [go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc).

The approach was proven by [kjjohnsen/HomeAssistantADCCameraIntegration](https://github.com/kjjohnsen/HomeAssistantADCCameraIntegration), which does the same thing in the browser. This project ports the signaling protocol to Node.js for headless server-side operation.

## Architecture

Two containers: the bridge holds the Alarm.com credentials and stays on the
default Docker bridge network; go2rtc runs on `network_mode: host` because
HomeKit needs mDNS multicast, which bridge networking does not forward. They
address each other over the host's LAN address (`ADC_BRIDGE_BIND_ADDRESS`),
never `localhost`.

## How the signaling works

The ADC end-to-end WebRTC signaling protocol (ported from the HA integration's `alarm-webrtc-card.js`):

1. Fetch video token: `GET /web/api/video/videoSources/liveVideoHighestResSources/<cameraId>`
2. Extract `endToEndWebrtcConnectionInfo` from response (signalling URL, JWT token, camera auth token, ICE servers)
3. Connect WebSocket to `${signallingServerUrl}/${signallingServerToken}`
4. Send `HELLO 2.0.1` → receive `HELLO`
5. Send `START_SESSION <cameraAuthToken>` → receive `SESSION_STARTED`
6. Receive SDP offer (JSON) → create answer with werift → send answer back
7. Exchange ICE candidates
8. WebRTC media flows (H.264 1080p @ 10fps)

### Key discovery: camera wake timing

The `liveVideoHighestResSources` API call triggers the camera to wake up and dial in to the signaling server. The camera takes a few seconds to connect, so:
- First attempt usually fails with "Camera has not yet dialed in"
- Retry with a fresh token after 15 seconds — the camera is now awake
- Subsequent retries use 10-second intervals

The bridge refreshes video tokens every 10 minutes and rebuilds the token-bound WebRTC connection while keeping the RTSP publisher alive. ADC telemetry confirms there is no server-enforced session timeout; the refresh interval is set conservatively to keep signaling credentials fresh.

## Current status

**Working:**
- Alarm.com authentication via `node-alarm-dot-com`
- Camera discovery CLI (`npx tsx src/discover.ts`)
- Video token fetching and refresh (10-minute cycle)
- End-to-end WebRTC signaling (HELLO/START_SESSION/SDP/ICE)
- WebRTC connection establishment with STUN/TURN
- H.264 RTP packet extraction from werift
- H.264 fmtp passthrough (profile-level-id, sprop-parameter-sets from camera SDP offer)
- ffmpeg RTSP output to go2rtc
- Stable ffmpeg publisher ownership across intentional stops and WebRTC replacements
- Hardened Docker containers: the credential-holding bridge and go2rtc are separate images and separate network namespaces
- Multi-camera streaming (3 cameras verified, 1920x1080 H.264 @ 10fps)
- Camera dial-in retry with exponential backoff (up to 12 attempts)
- Circuit breakers on all three Alarm.com retry loops (see [Retry limits](#retry-limits))
- Real-time motion detection via ADC WebSocket event stream
- WebSocket event listener with proactive token refresh and exponential backoff on errors
- Motion webhook forwarding to `@homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg`
- HomeKit live view and motion notifications via Homebridge
- HomeKit Secure Video (HKSV) recording triggered by motion events

- **Local RTSP over the camera's own HTTPS tunnel** (`src/rtsp/tunnel-relay.ts`) — no cloud, no video
  token, no WebRTC, and **no ffmpeg in the media path**: go2rtc pulls it with its native client and
  muxes HKSV in process. Enabled per camera with a `localRtsp` block; see [Setup](docs/SETUP.md).
  This is the only possible path for ADC-V515 cameras.

**Not yet done:**
- Fetching the local RTSP endpoints automatically — they live on `mobile.alarm.com`, a different API
  from the one this bridge speaks, so today they are configured by hand
- go2rtc stream auto-configuration (currently manual in `config/go2rtc.yaml`)
- Audio passthrough (the local RTSP stream carries no audio track at all)

## Setup

See the **[Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md)** for the full end-to-end instructions.
For Synology Container Manager, use the dedicated
**[Synology Deployment Guide](docs/SYNOLOGY.md)**, including its safe update and
rebuild procedure.

**Quick start:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Peak-Innovation-Studios/adc-video-bridge.git
cd adc-video-bridge
cp .env.example .env
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
cp config/go2rtc.example.yaml config/go2rtc.yaml
# Put credentials and random go2rtc passwords in .env; put camera IDs in config.yaml.
chmod 600 .env config/config.yaml config/go2rtc.yaml
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

Pulling source changes does not update an already-built container. After every
code update, rebuild with `docker compose up -d --build`. Configuration-only
changes can use `docker compose restart`.

## Environment variables

Credentials should be provided through environment variables or Docker secret files. Environment values take precedence over legacy credentials in `config.yaml`.

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `ADC_USERNAME` | Alarm.com account email | Yes |
| `ADC_PASSWORD` | Alarm.com account password | Yes |
| `ADC_MFA_TOKEN` | Two-factor authentication token (from trusted device setup) | No |
| `ADC_USERNAME_FILE` | File containing the Alarm.com username | Alternative to `ADC_USERNAME` |
| `ADC_PASSWORD_FILE` | File containing the Alarm.com password | Alternative to `ADC_PASSWORD` |
| `ADC_MFA_TOKEN_FILE` | File containing the optional MFA token | No |
| `GO2RTC_API_USERNAME` | Username protecting snapshots and the go2rtc API | Docker: yes |
| `GO2RTC_API_PASSWORD` | Random password protecting snapshots and the go2rtc API | Docker: yes |
| `GO2RTC_RTSP_USERNAME` | Username protecting RTSP playback | Docker: yes |
| `GO2RTC_RTSP_PASSWORD` | Random password protecting RTSP playback | Docker: yes |
| `ADC_BRIDGE_BIND_ADDRESS` | Host LAN address go2rtc binds its RTSP and API listeners to, and the address the bridge uses to reach it. Must be the server's real LAN address (e.g. `192.168.1.10`); the `127.0.0.1` fallback does not work with the two-container split. | Docker: yes |

See `.env.example` and `config/config.example.yaml` for the full configuration reference.

## Security

- Use a dedicated Alarm.com login with only the permissions needed to view the selected cameras.
- Keep `.env`, real camera configuration, logs, and Homebridge URLs out of source control.
- go2rtc runs on `network_mode: host`, where Compose `ports:` is ignored — the `listen:` addresses in `config/go2rtc.yaml` are the only thing keeping ports 8554 and 1984 off every interface. Set `ADC_BRIDGE_BIND_ADDRESS` to one trusted LAN address and restrict both ports at the host firewall.
- go2rtc requires Basic authentication for snapshot/API requests, loopback included (`local_auth: true`), and for every RTSP request that does not arrive over loopback — go2rtc skips RTSP auth for loopback unconditionally, so that protection comes from binding to the LAN address rather than from a setting. Its unused WebRTC listener is disabled; the SRTP listener is required once native HomeKit is configured.
- Both containers run without root privileges, drop Linux capabilities, and use a read-only filesystem. The bridge image is pinned to a base-image digest; the go2rtc image is built from source (HKSV is unreleased) with its toolchain pinned by digest and its source pinned to a commit SHA — see `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.
- This remains an unofficial cloud integration. Alarm.com can change or restrict the endpoints at any time.

## Dependencies

- [node-alarm-dot-com](https://github.com/node-alarm-dot-com/node-alarm-dot-com) — Alarm.com authentication
- [werift](https://github.com/nicknisi/werift-webrtc) — Pure TypeScript WebRTC (server-side PeerConnection)
- [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) — WebSocket client for ADC signaling
- [go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc) — RTSP server (accepts ffmpeg push, serves to clients)
- [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) — Structured logging
- ffmpeg — RTP → RTSP transcoding (copy mode, no re-encoding)

## Limitations

### Not a 24/7 stream

ADC cameras are designed for on-demand live view, not continuous streaming. The bridge holds a perpetual live view session by refreshing tokens every 10 minutes, but this is a workaround — ADC does not officially support persistent streaming. ADC telemetry confirms there is no server-enforced WebRTC session timeout, so the 10-minute interval is conservative.

### API rate limits

Alarm.com may ban accounts that poll too aggressively. Known safe minimums (from [homebridge-node-alarm-dot-com](https://github.com/node-alarm-dot-com/homebridge-node-alarm-dot-com)):

- **Session re-authentication**: ≥10 minutes (bridge uses 55 min)
- **Device polling**: ≥60 seconds (bridge uses 10 min per camera)

With multiple cameras, aggregate API load scales linearly — 3 cameras means a video token API call roughly every 200 seconds.

### Retry limits

Exponential backoff bounds the *rate* between attempts but not the *duration* of
attempting: a saturated ladder is still an infinite loop. Each of the three
Alarm.com retry loops — the video token poll, the stream retry ladder, and the
event WebSocket — is therefore wrapped in a circuit breaker. After a run of
consecutive failures the loop pauses, logs once at `error`, and continues only as
occasional probes on an escalating cooldown (5 min → 15 min → 30 min → 1 hour,
then hourly). It probes indefinitely and closes on the first success, so recovery
needs no restart.

An open circuit appears in the periodic status line as `(circuit open)` next to
the affected camera, or as `eventCircuit: open` for the event stream.

The breaker treats "did not produce a usable result" as the failure, not "threw".
Alarm.com answers a camera it cannot reach with HTTP 200 and `errorEnum: 0`, and
simply omits the WebRTC block — so a breaker counting exceptions would sit closed
through exactly the outage it exists for.

## Future exploration

### Native HKSV via go2rtc ([#11](https://github.com/Omar-L/adc-video-bridge/issues/11))

go2rtc PR [AlexxIT/go2rtc#2130](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/pull/2130) adds native HomeKit Secure Video support with a standalone `pkg/hksv/` library. This would eliminate the entire Homebridge stack — go2rtc would expose cameras directly to Apple Home with H.264 passthrough (no re-encoding), lower latency, and motion events via a simple HTTP API. See issue [#11](https://github.com/Omar-L/adc-video-bridge/issues/11) for the full analysis and phased rollout plan.
